# Advent of Code

>Prompt: Write a cheeky README.md

Greetings fellow coders! This repository is my coding playground for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com). Join me as I struggle through a series of daily programming challenges, improving our problem-solving skills and diving deep into algorithms and data mending.

## What's Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is a series of programming puzzles released during December, one per day until Christmas. It's a great way to learn and practice coding skills while enjoying the festive spirit.
